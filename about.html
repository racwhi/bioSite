        Shelley White is my sister, and this bioSite project is about her and
        grief. My sister passed away this year(2023) in February from
        complications of type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.
        Shelley was diagnosed at the age of 13, and she fought the disease every
        day until her body could no longer fight. Shelley was a beautiful,
        intelligent, caring,respectful , brave, strong and a kind person. She
        had a heart of gold. She was someone you could always count on. Shelley
        was and is the bravest, strongest person I know. Throughout her illness,
        she never complained. Shelley tried to live life to the best of her
        ability. Shelley's greatest joy in life was being a mother to her
        daughter; the two were inseparable. Shelley loved her family with all
        her heart. Even though Shelley was ill, her death was unexpected. When
        she died, it was and still is a pain like no other. It's extremely tough
        when you lose a loved one. I added the below insert about grief with a
        link to a website the more information.

        <em>
          "What is grief? Grief is a natural response to loss. It’s the
          emotional suffering you feel when something or someone you love is
          taken away. Often, the pain of loss can feel overwhelming. You may
          experience all kinds of difficult and unexpected emotions, from shock
          or anger to disbelief, guilt, and profound sadness. The pain of grief
          can also disrupt your physical health, making it difficult to sleep,
          eat, or even think straight. These are normal reactions to loss—and
          the more significant the loss, the more intense your grief will be.
          Coping with the loss of someone or something you love is one of life’s
          biggest challenges. You may associate grieving with the death of a
          loved one—which is often the cause of the most intense type of
          grief—but any loss can cause grief, including: Even subtle losses in
          life can trigger a sense of grief."</em
