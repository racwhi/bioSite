        about their day as they walked around the store and, like most would
        say, "shopped until they dropped." Shelley was always with her daughter
        when she was not in the hospital. Shelley ensured she spent as much time
        as she could with her daughter. Shelley enjoyed cooking and eating. She
        had a few restaurants that she enjoyed.Shelley also enjoyed traveling
        when she was able to travel. Shelley loved her family. Shelley enjoyed
        spending time with family, organizing family events, and helping aunts,
        cousins, and anyone in need.
